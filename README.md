# Steganography

图像加密

# OVERVIEW

```
Image steganography is an effective way to exchange hidden messages without raising suspicion. It works by encoding the message into the color values of the image's pixels.

With recent browser features like the File API and Canvas, we can implement this technique in a browser without any server-side code at all.
